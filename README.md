# Amazon Price Tracker

This project builds a web scraper to track Amazon product prices over time. Beautiful Soup is used to parse product information from an Amazon URL. The script extracts the product title and price, and saves this data to a CSV file along with the current date.


#### The main components include:

-- requests to download the page content

-- BeautifulSoup to parse and extract key elements

-- Writing scraped data to a CSV file

-- Scheduling the scraper to run daily using time.sleep()

--The full code can scrape a product page, clean the data, and append new price info to the CSV. This allows tracking price history and setting up pricing alerts.


## bonus -- Scraped wikipedia page of largest companies in the world by revenue
